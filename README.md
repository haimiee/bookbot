# BookBot
Welcome to BookBot, my very first GitHub project! This program marks the start of my coding journey, where I learned to push code, upload projects to GitHub, and make my very first commits.

## What Does BookBot Do?
- BookBot is a simple Python script that:
- Counts words in a text file.
- Tracks how many times each letter of the alphabet appears.
- Outputs a summary report.

## How to Use


## Example Output
```text
--- Begin report of books/frankenstein.txt ---
37812 words were found in the document 

The 'e' character was found 20098 times
The 't' character was found 14950 times
The 'a' character was found 12345 times
...
The 'z' character was found 23 times

--- End report ---
```

## Why This Project is Special
This project is special because it represents:
- My first steps into the world of Git and GitHub.
- The moments of when I learned how to push code, make commits, and share my work with the world.
- The foundation of my journey to becoming a real programmer.

## Lessons Learned
- How to use git init, git add, git commit, and git push.
- The importance of commit messages (even if they're "silly" at first).
- How fun and exciting it is to build something from scratch.
